## Usage

### Add as dependency

To use `ircv3-rs` in your project, you need to add it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file. The crate has been published to crates.io, but as we're < v1.0.0, you're best off depending on the master branch if you'd like to play around.

```toml
[dependencies]
ircv3 = { git = "https://github.com/sigkell/ircv3-rs" }
```
